1. Final design - a revised class diagram with explanation, and any changes we have made
2. Validation Testing Strategy - set of test cases based on use cases. 
                               - should be described in a way third party can understand and perform on system
                               a. Test Number
                               b. Purpose of test
                               c. test inputs - enough detail that a third party can execute
                               d. expected outputs - lets the third party determine whether the test has
                               completed successfully.
3. Describe JUnit Testing Strategy - describe how the group is going to achieve this.
                            a. how we are going to identify JUnit test cases
                            b. How we are approaching it as a group 
                            - these will be examined in week 10 but the actual cases will not be 
                            submitted yet
4. Updated project plan - who's working on what and by what date - Gantt Chart
5. Executable jars - flipper triggering 
                - absorber, ball motion, gravity and friction 
                -ball collisions with bumpers and walls
                -loading files in standard format
