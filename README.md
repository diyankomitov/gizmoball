## Gizmoball

This was a 3rd year group project at the University of Strathclyde as part of the CS308 - Building Software Systems class of the Computer Science and Software Engineering courses.

It was developed in collaboration with Jessica Stephenson, Lauren Higgins and Alistair Gillies and supervised by Murray Wood

This project involved designing, documenting, building and testing a game called Gizmoball. Gizmoball is a a version of the game pinball with a couple of differences. The main one being that besides playing the game, the user is also able to design the playing field on which to play. That includes doing things such as adding different gizmos, adjusting the gravity and more.

Overall this was a really fun group project which allowed me to get the full experience of developing software. Not only building, but also requirements gathering, designing, and testing which are all an important part of software development.
